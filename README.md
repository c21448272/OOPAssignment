The main class is called control, which extends the JFrame class and implements the ActionListener interface. 
Here's a list of the classes I used in the code:
JFrame: A top-level container that contains and organizes GUI components, 
JMenuBar - A horizontal bar that displays menus. JMenu - A component that displays a menu. JMenuItem - An item in a menu. JPanel - A container that can hold other components. JLabel - A non-editable text field that can display an image. JButton - A component that performs an action when clicked. JTextField - A text field where users can enter text. JTextArea - A multi-line text area where text can be displayed. JScrollPane - A container that adds scroll bars to a component. ImageIcon - An icon that can be displayed in a label or button. 

The core functionality includes:
I created a GUI with buttons, panels, labels, and menus, eading a file and storing its content in memory and allowing users to search for a term in the file and displaying the matching lines.

Optional functionality includes:
Displaying an image in the GUI, changing the icon of the frame, using a pop-up dialog box to confirm the user's choice to exit. I also set the font, color, and alignment of the label and the size and visibility of the panels, buttons, and menus.

If I more time, I'd add better error checking and more user inputs, such radio buttons and a checkbox.
